 * Copyright (c) YEAR Author. All rights reserved.
 *
 * Software vX.X
 * by Author (author@mail.com)
 *
 * Software vX.X is distributed under the "Artistic License" detailed below:
 *
 *
 *                           The ``Artistic License''
 *
 * Preamble
 * The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may
 * be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
 * control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the
 * package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary
 * fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.
 *
 * Definitions
 *     ``Package'' refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
 *     Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
 *     modification.
 *     ``Standard Version'' refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
 *     or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder
 *     as specified below.
 *     ``Copyright Holder'' is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for
 *     the package.
 *     ``You'' is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
 *     Package.
 *     ``Reasonable copying fee'' is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
 *     cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not
 *     be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
 *     community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
 *     ``Freely Available'' means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
 *     though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that
 *     recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
 *     received it.
 *
 *     1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
 *        Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
 *        duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 *     2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
 *        from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in
 *        such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 *     3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
 *        you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
 *        changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 *         a. place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
 *            Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
 *            equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
 *            such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
 *            your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 *         b. use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 *         c. rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
 *            standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
 *            separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
 *            documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 *         d. make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 *     4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
 *        form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 *         a. distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
 *            together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
 *            to get the Standard Version.
 *         b. accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
 *            Package with your modifications.
 *         c. give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document
 *            the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with
 *            instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
 *         d. make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 *     5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
 *        Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You
 *        may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute
 *        this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part
 *        of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do
 *        not advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this
 *        Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall
 *        be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete
 *        Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.
 *     6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
 *        from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the
 *        copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be
 *        sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts
 *        or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called "undump"
 *        or "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable image, then
 *        distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution
 *        of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and
 *        4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard
 *        Version of this Package.
 *     7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)
 *        supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines
 *        and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be
 *        considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in
 *        Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any
 *        way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.
 *     8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
 *        permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when
 *        no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the
 *        end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as
 *        a distribution of this Package.
 *     9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
 *        products derived from this software without specific prior written
 *        permission.
 *        THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 *        WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 *        MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 * The End
